# DevConnect

[Heroku] - https://dev--connect-de822571753c.herokuapp.com/

## Description

This app is a social media platform for developers and other professionals in the field of software engineering and web development to connect. Opposed to using something as casual and cluttered with distractions as Facebook or Instagram, we felt that a more professional app purely for developers to make connections would be more beneficial.

So that I can connect and discuss topics related to technology.

Given a login page,
When I am presented with the sign-in button,

Given a chats page, 
When I am presented with the option to chat with someone,
